## Project Summary
The robot is designed to deliver parcels autonomously, using GPS for navigation and ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection. The microcontroller (Arduino) processes sensor data and controls the motors and servo for movement and parcel handling. The Wi-Fi module facilitates communication for receiving delivery coordinates and sending status updates.

## Steps to Implement

Assemble the Robot: Connect motors, sensors, and modules to the microcontroller as per the circuit diagram.
Upload Code: Program the Arduino with the provided code.
Test the System: Conduct tests to ensure proper functioning of navigation, obstacle detection, and parcel handling.
Fine-Tune Parameters: Adjust parameters (e.g., speed, obstacle detection threshold) based on test results.
